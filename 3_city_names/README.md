This is a program written in Java that does the following things:

- contains a list of cities of Ukraine
- expect some city name in the input and respond with a new city that starts with the letter we have as the last letter from the user

List of tasks to update:

- transfer the list of cities to a separate file and import this file into the java code
- resolve cases where we have the last letter that does not exists as a first letter of a new city (handling a query with a letter before that character)
- create the same program in Python
